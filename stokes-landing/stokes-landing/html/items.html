                            <p>This is the microphone that I have at my desk at all times. For the price, 
                                it sounds amazing and it is definitely better than any built in mic you are 
                                going to find. It also does go on sale occasionally. The only big downside 
                                is that it uses Mini USB and I know that can be a deal breaker for some people.</p>

                                is by far the best plastic water bottle I have ever used. It comes in a variety of 
                                colors and it has a lid that uses magnets to help seal off the spout. It is also

                            I think that that is a shame because I absolutly love mine. It is super comfortable 
                            to one hand my phone using the popsocket and it doubles as a kick stand. You can also get 
                            PopSockets with pictures on them if you like that sort of thing.</p>

                            <p>If you use a laptop instead of a PC then you know the pain trying to look at a laptop's screen 
                                can cause you. For most people, myself included, laptop screens are just to low to the ground to be 
                                comfortable to use. A laptop stand fixes this because it allows you to position the laptop at 
                                the spot that is the most ergonomic for you. This stand is the one I use but you should be sure to 
                                get one that fits your laptop.</p>

                            <p>Accessories are a big part of using a computer and 90% of accessories require a USB port to use. 
                                There have been many times that I just simply did not have enough USB ports to use everything 
                                I needed to use. This usb hub helps to solve that problem by splitting 1 USB port into multiple. 
                                Some other features that this hub has are off switches for all of its usb ports and USB 3.0 compatibility.</p>
