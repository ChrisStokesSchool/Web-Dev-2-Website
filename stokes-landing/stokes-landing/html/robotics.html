                            <h6>The game being played for the current V5RC season is called "High Stakes" and it revolves 
                                around stacking rings onto several different kinds of posts called "Stakes". At the beginning of every 
                                match you are paired with another random robot and given a color. That color will determin what color 
                                rings you are trying to score. A ring has to be encircling a stake to be considered scored and a ring 
                                on the top of a scored ring stack is worth three points. Every ring that is not a top ring but 
                                is still considered scored is only worth one point. There are also modifiers in each corner 
                                of the feild that will either double the point values of every ring on a stake inside of the corner 
                                or convert the scored rings' points into negative points that will take points away from you at 
                                the end of the match. This is a very bare bones summary that leaves out a bunch so if you want to 
                                learn more you can read the

                            <p>Due to my status as team captain, I am in charge of making sure everything is running smoothly. It is my 
                                job to make sure that everyone is doing their job and that people are all on the same page. One of the 
                                biggest ways that I do this is by holding a team meeting at the end of every week in which we disscuss 
                                how the week went and what our plans for next week are. These are a great place for people to speak up if 
                                they think they need more time or if they are having an issue that they need to communicate.</p>

                            <p>The second half of my job is notebooking. I am in charge of keeping our engineering notebook up to date which 
                                means that if we make a change on the robot I have to go in a write about it as soon as I can. The notebook 
                                is also a place for us to put schedules, possible designs, programming updates, and more. Our notebook is 
                                currently at around 75 pages and climbing. </p>
