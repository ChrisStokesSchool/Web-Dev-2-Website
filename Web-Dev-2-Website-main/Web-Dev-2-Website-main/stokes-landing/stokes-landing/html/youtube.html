                            I script and voice all of my videos on my own but I do get help from my siblings when 
                            it comes time for recording and editing. I have not posted a video in a while because 
                            I have been insanely busy with robotics but I hope to get a video out by next week. </h3>

                        <p>I started doing youtube around when I turned 13 and I have been posting semi-consistently ever since then. 
                            I started doing it because I thought it would be fun to make videos and share them with the world and I 
                            would say that I was right. When I first started my channel I actually didn't know what kind of videos I wanted 
                            to make, I just knew I wanted to make videos. I experimented with all kinds of content such as let's plays and challenge 
                            videos, but it wasn't until around 7 months ago when I finally setteled on making game reviews and gaming/tech shorts. 
                            This change has helped my channel to grow because now I have a unified and consistent brand and people know what kind of 
                            videos to expect from me. It is a lot of work, but I know I will continue to do youtube for the foreseeable future.</p>
